- 无法识别周遭信号.

If the Eye called to us, why won't it reveal itself? Why is it so difficult to locate it?

如果眼在呼唤我们，那它为什么不现身？为什么要找到它那么困难？


Did something happen to it?

它出了什么事吗？


Did the signal stop? Does the Eye no longer desire to be found?

信号中断了吗？眼是不是又不想被我们找到了？


Perhaps this isn't the Eye's choice. The Eye may not be able to communicate with us more than it already has.

也许眼别无选择。眼可能只有通过这种方式才能和我们沟通。

Is the Eye natural, or artificial?

眼是自然形成的，还是人工制造的？


Maybe someone built it.

也许有人把它造了出来。


The Eye is older than the universe itself. How could something exist before its creator?

眼比宇宙本身还要古老。造物的历史怎么可能比造物主还要久远？


It could be naturally occurring, though this doesn't answer how the Eye could be as old as it is.

它可能是自然形成的，但这也无法解释为什么眼会如此古老。

Did the Eye deliberately call out to us by sending the signal, or did we hear the signal by coincidence?

是眼故意发出信号呼唤我们，还是说我们意外收到了那个信号？


We could be seeing meaning where there is none. Suppose the signal was produced incidentally.

我们可以从中推测出其意义所在。估计信号是无意间产生的。


Does that mean the Eye is any less important, though?

可难道这样一来，眼就不重要了吗？


Perhaps the Eye wanted to be found (could it be sentient?). Maybe it chose us.

也许眼希望有人能够找到它（它会不会具备智能？）。也许它选择了我们。


Does the Eye desire something from us? Could it need us in some way?

眼会不会想要我们帮它做点什么？它是不是需要我们？


Maybe it doesn't have to be us.

也许不一定非得是我们不可。
